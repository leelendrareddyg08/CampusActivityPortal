# CampusActivityPortal
## Introduction

Campus Activity Portal is a project in which user(s) can give the info about the events happened in their college to the other users or management. One who signs up into this portal will be able to check all the events that happened in the campus. If there is no info about an event that was conducted, then a particular user can add information about how the event was conducted, what are the main points of the event, who are the cheif guests etc.

The Project uses JSF (Java Server Faces) as the front end with the help of CSS. The backend was developed using JAVA EE. The connection between the JSF and the bussiness logic was done using the EJB (Enterprise Java Beans). The communication between the database and the application is done with the help of JPA (Java Persistence API). The database technology used was MySQL.
